# Ender-3-Pro-SKR-E3-Mini-v2.0

The configuration files I uploaded are for Marlin 2.0.7.2 branch. You must download and setup VScode on your machine and just import these files to your Marlin folder. The platformio.ini configuration that corresponds to the SKR board is: default_envs = STM32F103RC_btt_512K_USB. My board uses the STM32F103RCT6 chip. I've been using this with out any adverse issues.
